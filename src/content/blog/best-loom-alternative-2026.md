# Best Loom Alternative: Why Privacy-First wins in 2026

If you're like most creators, you've probably reached your limit with **Loom**. 

Between the sudden price hikes, the strict recording limits on free plans, and the nagging feeling that your sensitive work shouldn't be sitting on someone else's server, the search for a better way to record your screen is at an all-time high.

Enter **Gravity Recorder**.

## The Problem with SaaS Recording

Most screen recorders are **SaaS-first**. This means:
1. They require a mandatory login (even if you just want to record once).
2. They upload your data to their cloud immediately.
3. They paywall the "premium" features you actually need.

## The Gravity Advantage: Local-First

**Gravity Recorder** was built to flip the script. It is a **Loom alternative** designed specifically for users who value their privacy as much as their time.

### 1. 100% Privacy by Design
Gravity uses the **Browser File System Access API**. What does that mean for you? It means when you record, the video is written directly to **your hardware**. We never see your data, because we don't have a backend to store it.

### 2. Studio-Grade Aesthetics
Inspired by tools like **Tella**, Gravity offers a "Studio" feel entirely in the browser. You get glassmorphism, neon neon accents, and a draggable webcam—all for $0.

### 3. Zero Friction
No account creation. No subscription. You just open the site, hit record, and you're professional in seconds.

## Conclusion

If you're looking for a **free Loom alternative** that doesn't compromise on quality or privacy, it's time to try Gravity.
