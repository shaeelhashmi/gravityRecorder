If you're like most creators, you've probably reached your limit with **Loom**. 

Between moving basic features behind a paywall, strict recording limits on free plans, and the privacy concern of storing sensitive demos on cloud servers, the search for a better way to record your screen is at an all-time high.

## Why Gravity is the #1 Loom Alternative for Privacy

Most screen recorders are **SaaS-first**. This means:
1. They require a mandatory login (even if you just want to record once).
2. They upload your video to *their* servers before you even see the link.
3. They control your data access with "Pro" tiers.

**Gravity Recorder** flips the script. It is a **local-first** studio that runs entirely in your browser. Your recording never hits a centralized server unless you explicitly choose to sync it.

## The Power of Local-First Screen Recording

Unlike traditional cloud recorders, Gravity processes everything on your device. This architecture provides three massive advantages over the competition:

### 1. Absolute Confidentiality
Whether you're recording a secure internal demo or a sensitive architectural walkthrough, you never have to worry about a data breach on a third-party server. Your files stay in your browser's local storage.

### 2. Zero-Latency Studio
Because we don't rely on slow cloud uploads while you record, the UI remains fluid and responsive. You can switch backgrounds, toggle your webcam mask, and adjust HSL themes without a single frame of lag.

### 3. Google Drive Sync (Optional)
When you *do* want to share, we don't force you into our cloud. You can sync directly to your own **Google Drive**, maintaining 100% ownership and control over your storage.

## Key Features that Beat Loom

- **100% Private**: Your pixels, your privacy. No mandatory cloud storage.
- **Studio-Grade Aesthetics**: Change backgrounds and webcam masks for a professional "Studio" look.
- **Zero Infrastructure**: No Docker, no databases, no setup. Just open the URL and record.
- **Permanent Open Source**: Gravity will always be free and community-driven.

## Conclusion

If you want a professional, private, and powerful way to share your ideas without the monthly subscription, Gravity is the future of screen recording. It’s time to stop paying for your own productivity and start owning your data.
