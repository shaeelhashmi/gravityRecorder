# Gravity vs Tella: Comparing the Aesthetic Kings

In the world of high-end video recording, **Tella** has long been the king of the "Aesthetic" video. But for many solo creators, a monthly subscription for recording is a barrier they don't want to cross.

**Gravity Recorder** is the newest challenger: an open-source, web-based studio that gives you that premium look without the recurring bill.

## The "Studio" Experience

Creators love Tella for its flexibility. Gravity takes that same philosophy and pushes it into the browser:

*   **Shape-Shifting Webcams**: Instantly switch between circle, square, or rounded webcam profiles.
*   **Draggable UI**: Move yourself (the webcam) anywhere on the capture area mid-recording.
*   **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Choose from cosmic rings or sleek mesh gradients to make your tutorial pop.

## Why Open Source Wins

Because Gravity is open source and hosted on Vercel, it leverages horizontal scaling without costs. We don't need to put features behind a paywall because our infra cost is near-zero compared to a traditional SaaS.

## Which one should you use?

If you need professional team collaboration and a cloud video library, Tella is fantastic. 

But if you are a **developer, solo founder, or privacy advocate** who wants a beautiful recording saved directly to your local disk, **Gravity Recorder** is the ultimate Tella alternative.
