In the world of product demos, **aesthetics are no longer optional**. 

Platforms like **Tella** changed the game by realizing that a floating circle isn't enough—creators want padding, rounded corners, custom backgrounds, and a "studio" feel that makes their software look like a piece of art.

But Tella’s premium polish comes with a premium price tag. If you're a bootstrapper or a developer just trying to share your progress, $15-20 a month for "rounded corners" can feel like a lot.

Enter **Gravity Recorder**: The free, open-source Tella alternative designed for creators who value design as much as their bank balance.

## What Makes a "Studio" Recorder?

A standard screen recorder captures your screen. A **Screen Studio** (like Tella or Gravity) *composes* it. 

To be a true Tella alternative, a tool needs:
1. **Dynamic Layouts**: The ability to move and resize your webcam overlay.
2. **Premium Backgrounds**: Not just solid colors, but gradients and textures that add depth.
3. **Framing**: Adding padding around the screen capture to make it look like a professional video production rather than just a full-screen grab.

## How Gravity Delivers the Tella Aesthetic for Free

Gravity Recorder was built from the ground up to prioritize these design elements without the proprietary lock-in.

### 1. The Canvas-Powered Studio
Unlike basic recorders, Gravity uses a hidden `<canvas>` engine to composite your webcam, screen, and background in real-time. This allows for:
- **webcam masks**: Smooth circular or rounded-rect masks for your camera.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle shadows and border effects that make your UI pop.

### 2. High-Performance Backgrounds
We’ve curated a set of "Cosmic" and "Minimalist" background gradients that mirror the high-end look of paid tools. Whether you want a dark, moody vibe or a clean, slate-colored light mode, it’s all available with one click.

### 3. Local-First Privacy
While Tella is a great cloud-first tool, Gravity is **local-first**. Your high-resolution recordings are processed on your device. No waiting for slow cloud uploads before you can see your result.

## Why Open Source is the Future of Creation

The best part of Gravity Recorder isn't just that it's a "Tella alternative"—it's that it belongs to the community. 
- **No Watermarks**: Your brand stays yours.
- **No Recording Limits**: 5 minutes or 5 hours, the cost is the same: $0.
- **Transparent Logic**: Want to know how we handle your pixels? Check the code on GitHub.

## Conclusion

You shouldn't have to choose between a professional look and a sustainable budget. Gravity Recorder gives you the studio tools you need to make your product shine, without the monthly subscription.
