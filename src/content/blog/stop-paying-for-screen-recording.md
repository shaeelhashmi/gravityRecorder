# The Death of SaaS Privacy?

Every week, we hear about another cloud provider having a leak. When you record your internal meetings, your SaaS product demos, or your private code walkthroughs on a cloud-first recorder, you are taking a risk.

In 2026, the safest cloud for your data is your **own hard drive**.

## What is Local-First?

Local-first software combines the convenience of a web app with the security of a local application. **Gravity Recorder** is built on this principle.

### Your Video, Your Disk
By using modern web APIs, Gravity writes data directly to your local file system. Most "free" recorders out there aren't actually free—you pay with your data. We've removed that cost entirely.

## Zero Tracking, Maximum Speed

Because we don't track your every move, the app uses fewer system resources. This means more power for your screen capture and less lag during high-bitrate recordings.

## Support Open Source

Gravity is 100% open source. You can audit our code right now on GitHub to see exactly how we handle (or rather, *don't* handle) your data.
