## 🚀 Why Gravity? (The Tella Alternative)

Most screen recorders require logins, upload your data to their servers, and hit you with subscription walls. **Gravity is built differently.**

### ⚖️ Comparison: SaaS vs. Gravity

| Feature | Loom / Tella / Cap | Gravity Recorder |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price** | Paid Subscriptions | **$0 (100% Free)** |
| **Privacy** | Stored on Cloud | **Local-First (Privacy)** |
| **Login** | Mandatory Account | **No Login Required** |
| **Setup** | Docker / S3 / SQL | **Zero Infrastructure** |
| **Aesthetics** | Generic | **Studio-Grade UI** |

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Multi-Layer Gallery**: Overlay your webcam on your screen with real-time scaling and styling.
- **🔳 Shape-Shifting Webcam**: Switch between Circle, Square, and Rounded patterns instantly.
- **📍 Draggable Studio**: Move your webcam and UI elements anywhere on the canvas while recording.
- **📂 Hybrid Cloud Sync**: Integrated with Google Drive API. Keep the source local, share the link in seconds.
- **⚙️ Direct Hardware Access**: Zero-lag recording using direct-to-disk chunking via the File System Access API.

## 🛡️ Technical FAQ

### 1. How is it private if it's a web app?
Gravity uses the **Browser File System Access API**. We don't have a backend to store your videos. When you hit save, the browser writes the stream directly to a folder you select on your computer. Your data never touches our servers.

### 2. Does it work on all browsers?
Gravity is optimized for **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave) which support the advanced File System and Media Capture APIs.

### 3. How do I get a "Prebuilt" release?
Gravity is a high-performance **Web Studio** accessible directly via the web. Standalone Electron builds (.exe/.dmg) are currently in development.

## 🔑 Google Cloud Setup (Step-by-Step)

To enable the **Google Drive Cloud Sync** feature locally, you need to configure a Google Cloud Project. Follow these detailed steps:

### 1. Create a Project
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Click the project dropdown (top left) and select **New Project**.
- Name it `Gravity Recorder` and click **Create**.

### 2. Enable APIs
- In the sidebar, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
- Search for **"Google Drive API"**.
- Click on it and click **Enable**.

### 3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen
- Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
- Select **User Type: External** and click **Create**.
- **App Information**: Enter `Gravity Recorder` as the app name and your email for support.
- **Scopes**: 
    - Click **Add or Remove Scopes**.
    - Manually add this scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` (this allows Gravity to only see files it creates, maximizing user privacy).
    - Add `.../auth/userinfo.profile` and `.../auth/userinfo.email` for the login feature.
- **Test Users**: Add your own Gmail address so you can log in during development.

### 4. Create Credentials
- Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.

#### Create OAuth Client ID (For Login/Sync):
- Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
- Set **Application type** to `Web application`.
- **Name**: `Gravity Local Dev`.
- **Authorized JavaScript origins**: Add `http://localhost:5173`.
- Click **Create** and copy your **Client ID**.

#### Create API Key (For API access):
- Click **Create Credentials > API Key**.
- **Important**: To prevent unauthorized use, click **Edit API Key** and under **API restrictions**, select "Restrict key" and check **Google Drive API**.
- Copy your **API Key**.

### 5. Update your `.env`
Paste both values into your `.env` file:
```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_id_here.apps.googleusercontent.com
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
